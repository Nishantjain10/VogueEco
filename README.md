# About VogueEco

- VogueEco is a web app which focusses on the reising issue of increasing Carbon Footprint led by the Fashion industry due to the excessive use of Synthetic Fibres.

- The goal of this project is to aware the public about the issue and its impact. And encouraging them to "Donate their old clothes" and "Plant a Tree" through our initiative. Through this, we can give our contribution to reduce Carbon Footprint.

# Technologies Used

- To create the Frontend, we used React.js & some of its libraries like React-Router, along with Tailwind CSS for styling.

- For the Backend, we used the services of Appwrite for authentication of the users.

# How it Works
- The user is introduced to the landing page as soon as he/she opens the website, where we highlight our motive, the issues which are faced by the nature due to the Fashion Industry, followed by the solutions given by us. All this frontend part is developed using React.js and Tailwind CSS.

- To contribute to our cause, users can click the initiative they want to be a part of. They will be soon redirected to a Login/Signup Page, once Logged In, they can choose the amount of clothes they want to donate or Trees they want to plant, and can fill some basic information through the form.

- Once done, they will be redirected to a Certificate Page, showing their contribution.
